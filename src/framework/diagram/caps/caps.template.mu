// Default connector cap catalog — the five built-in arrow / circle /
// diamond end-caps from § 3.6 of
// [src/document/connectors.md](../../../document/connectors.md).
//
// Each cap is a DataTemplate keyed for `@…Cap` reference, rendering a
// single `Path` whose geometry is authored in CAP-LOCAL coordinates with
// the hot-point (arrow tip / circle centre) at local (0,0) and the body
// trailing into −X. The connector pipeline pins that origin to the
// resolved endpoint (Canvas.Left/Top) and rotates about it by the route
// tangent — flipping the source end 180° so one template reads correctly
// at both ends. See Connector.placeCap.
//
// `Connector.CapInset` (attached property) tells the route how far back
// to stop the painted line so it doesn't poke through a filled cap.
// Caps that sit ON the line (open arrow, open circle) leave it at 0.
//
// Paint binds against the per-end ConnectorCapDataContext the connector
// supplies as the cap's DataContext:
//   * filled caps  → Fill   = $Brush   (the connector's stroke colour)
//   * stroked caps → Stroke = $Pen     (the connector's full Pen)
// so a recoloured / rethickened connector recolours its caps.
//
// Merged into the root MuralFramework dictionary via an `import` clause
// in src/resources/framework.resources.mu.
