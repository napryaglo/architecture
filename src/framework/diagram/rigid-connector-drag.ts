// Rigid-translate handshake between the figure-drag mechanics (Figure

// drags, connectors INTERNAL to the selection — both endpoints' nodes in
// the moving set — should translate rigidly, preserving the user's
// hand-bent waypoints, instead of the per-figure reroute clearing them.
//
// Figure can't see the connector list (connectors live on the Diagram),
// and Diagram doesn't own the drag, so the two cooperate through this
// pair of interfaces. Figure resolves its enclosing Diagram and casts it
// to RigidConnectorDragHost (the cross-class-internals pattern — a named,
// greppable interface rather than bracket access), avoiding the
// diagram → figure import cycle that a direct type reference would add.
// Internal to mural; never part of the published surface.
