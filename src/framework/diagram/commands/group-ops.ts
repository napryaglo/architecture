// Group / Ungroup commands fire framework events on Diagram (consumer
// subscribes via Diagram.AddGroupRequestedListener / AddUngroupRequestedListener).
// The framework does NOT mutate the consumer's data collection — Diagram
// has no knowledge of where the items live or how to materialize a group.
//
// The consumer's listener typically:
//   * GroupRequested  → creates a new IGroup instance, re-parents Items
//                       to it, adds the new group to its collection
//   * UngroupRequested → re-parents each Group's Members back to their
//                       grandparent, removes the Group from its collection
//
// Pure helpers in this file: identify the top-level subset of a
// selection (used by CanExecute gating) and detect group-shape entities.

// Walk Parent links up to the root. Same algorithm as the demo's
// topLevelOf — returns the entity itself when Parent is absent.
// Used to elevate clicked leaves to their outermost containing group.
