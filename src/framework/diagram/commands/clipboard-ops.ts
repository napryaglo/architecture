// snapshot), but not where the data lives; the consumer's listener writes
// it to the clipboard. Cut is a CopyRequested followed by DeleteRequested,
// so this event carries no "also delete" flag.
//
// `Items` / `Connectors` are the SelectedItems / SelectedConnectors
// snapshots at keypress time — stable, like DeleteRequestedArgs.
